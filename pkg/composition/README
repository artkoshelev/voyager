This directory holds Composition layer from Voyager architecture.

### Miscellaneous from @bbarclay to get started

#### Start Composition controller

If you don't want to use minikube, but instead docker for mac
```
export KUBE_CONTEXT=docker-for-desktop
make update-bazel; make run-voyager
```

#### Create the Service Descriptor CRD

From voyager "root" directory in source tree
```
make print-sd-crd > SOME_FILE
```

Delete the top (3?) lines of the file until "apiVersion" is at the top and then run

```
kubectl create -f SOME_FILE
```

* If you add a test to a directoy that did not previously had a test, from voyager root, run
```
make fmt-bazel
```
